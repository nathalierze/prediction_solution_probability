Solution Probability Model and Fairness Evaluation

This in-session prediction model seeks to predict the usersâ€™ performance on the Orthografietrainer.net platform.
The target variable is binary and predicts if the user will do the following sentence correctly or not. 
For fairness evaluations the best models (MLP and DTE), and the worst model (SVM) are considered. A random state is not set, thus, results might differ marginally.
